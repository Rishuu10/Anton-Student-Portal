## About the Project

During the pandemic time, most educational institutes have been forced to opt for online education. With the advent of online education, malpractices crept into the education system. Students have taken to unfair practices during examinations and even during daily classes. 

Our platform aims to resolve this unfair means by developing a robust system that can prevent loss of concentration during daily classes by continous proctoring and quizes.
